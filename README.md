# Subscription Tracker API

   

A robust RESTful API designed to power a modern subscription management application. This backend allows users to track their recurring subscriptions, monitor spending, and receive scheduled, durable email reminders for upcoming payments using Upstash Workflow.

-----

## \#\# Features

  * üîê **Secure JWT Authentication**: User registration and login handled via JSON Web Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
  * üí≥ **Full Subscription Management**: Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for subscriptions.
  * üîî **Durable Payment Reminders**: Utilizes **Upstash Workflow** to reliably schedule and send email reminders on a predefined schedule (e.g., 7, 5, 2, and 1 day before renewal).
  * üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Security**: Integrated **Arcjet** middleware for rate limiting and bot detection to protect API endpoints.
  * üë§ **User Profile Management**: Endpoints for users to view and manage their own profile information.
  * üìä **Analytics & Dashboard**: Dedicated endpoints to provide summaries of monthly/yearly spending and breakdowns by category.
  * üè∑Ô∏è **Category Management**: Allows users to create, update, and delete custom subscription categories for better organization.
  * ‚ú® **Centralized Error Handling**: A dedicated error middleware ensures consistent and predictable error responses.

## \#\# Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### \#\#\# Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
  * npm or yarn
  * MongoDB (a local instance or a cloud URI from MongoDB Atlas)
  * An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account for Redis/Workflow.
  * An [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com/) account for the security middleware key.

### \#\#\# 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### \#\#\# 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### \#\#\# 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and populate it with your credentials.

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Database and Authentication
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_random_secret_string_for_jwt
JWT_EXPIRE=1d

# Upstash Workflow Credentials
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_rest_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_rest_token

# Arcjet Security Key
ARCJET_KEY=your_arcjet_site_key

# Email Configuration (e.g., for Nodemailer with Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_google_app_password
```

### \#\#\# 4. Run the Server

```bash
# For development with automatic restart (if you have nodemon installed)
npm run dev

# For production
npm start
```

The API server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
